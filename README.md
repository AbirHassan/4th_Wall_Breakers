Proposed Title: “4th Wall Breakers”

Conceptually, our game will be a mashup of “Space Invaders” and “Pong.” There would be two opposing sides, one on the left and one on the right. The left side will be played by a computer, representing the US, while the right side will be the actual player, representing Mexico. Each side can move vertically (just like in Pong), and each side can shoot (like in Space Invaders). A wall would be placed between the two opposing sides. The goal of the player will be to deplete the computer’s health, but first the player would have to get rid of the wall blocking its path. However, as the player attempts to destroy parts of the wall, the computer player will be able to shoot through the wall and attack the player. If the player’s health is depleted, then the computer wins. (FOR HIGHER LEVELS) The computer can also deploy mini-units that can move and shoot as well.

Proposed Controls:
Up and Down arrow keys to move
Spacebar to shoot
Enter/Return to pause
Esc to quit
